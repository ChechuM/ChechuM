### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Who am I? 

In a few words: 
I'm a Full Stack Developer with experience working on NodeJS, React, JavaScript, Redux, SQL, and Express among other technologies in the sector. I also have a solid background in Health Care working in hospitals and health centres as a Biochemist. 

I'm passionate about nature in general and the human body in particular. My dream job would be to be part of a biomedical engineering company that helps develop new devices and technologies for improving health.

Hungry for challenges and new experiences, my main drive at the moment is growth. 

I am proud of my logical thinking and my problem-solving focus. I consider myself reliable and committed and I can understand the bigger picture and work towards it as part of a team. 

My intentions? Learn and apply what I've learned, participating in a stimulating project in a win-win relationship. 

Let's associate!
